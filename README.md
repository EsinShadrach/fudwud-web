3. I think i should just move on and handle the order stuff later...
4. Payment pages...
5. So, maybe instead I can attach the userID and resturant to the order made on the server side and only send only the orders made by the present user
6. I have to structure the api endpoint properly
7. Attach the UserID to the order
8. Create get options
