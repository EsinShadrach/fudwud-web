1. I can't use a server function to handle orders
2. So, I'll have to use a state to handle the orders and all
3. the order cards should be changed according to the UI
4. Payment pages...
5. So, maybe instead I can attach the userID and resturant to the order made on the server side and only send only the orders made by the present user
